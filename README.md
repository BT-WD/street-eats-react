# Props in React

## Learning objectives
* Students will be able to pass props from a parent component to a child component.
* Students will be able to export and import variables between files.
* Students will be able to create components that operate as templates.

## Sequence

1. [Launch](#launch)
2. Passing a single property
3. Passing multiple properties
4. [Close](#close)

>

## Launch
Have students navigate to a website of their choice that is made with React (REMEMBER: They made a list of websites in the first lecture). Instruct students to Look over the page and look for any component of the website that seems to be repeated. The content doesn't have to be the same, but these components should have similar features. For example, the AirBnB website has cards that use that have a photo, title, price, and review; this is a repeated component. What repeated component can you find?

#### Questions for Students
* What component did you find that is repeated. What is similar about all these components?
* Why is repeatable components a common feature of react websites? How might this make programming websites easier for a developer?


## Components and props
As we have discussed, React allows developers to build websites by piecing together various components. This makes the development processing easier, as the website is now built with modular pieces that can be modified, added, and removed. But what if we want to make a reuse and customize a component without copy and pasting our code into a whole new component? That's where props come in, and this allows us to use our components as templates that can be customized with specified PROPerties (see what I did there?).

### Passing Our First Property
Props are passed from the parent element to the child element. We are going to pass our first prop from App.js component (parent) to our Testimonials.js (child) component. To do so, we are going to modify the code in the App.js and Testimonials.js files to the following:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
       	<Navbar/>
	<Splash/>
        <Testimonials userTestimonial = "We Eat Street Meat is the best food review site that has ever been built. Now I can 	     eat my street meat with confidence I can sit through my afternoon meetings."/>
    	<div className = "container">
    	  <div className="row">

          </div>
    	</div>
    </div>
    );
  }
}
```

You will notice we only modified line 16 of the code. We added an attribute to the Splash element; "firstTestimonial". By adding this attribute to our Testimonials element, it will be passed down as props from App.js.

From the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html): "When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”."

```javascript
function Testimonial(props){
  return(
    <div className="Testimonials">
      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-6 offset-3 testimonial">
          <h3 className="secondary-text-testimonial">Testimonial</h3>
          <p className="paragraph-text"> {props.userTestimonial}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now we are going to modify two lines of code in our Testimonials.js file:
We need to have our functional component take in a parameter called "props". By creating this parameter we are now able to pass the props object down from App.js into our Testimonial component.

We are then going to render our prop onto the screen. To embed our prop into the HTML we have written, we just have to add { props.testimonial } to the paragraph element on the page.

>It should be noted that this is also our first use of JSX syntax. React uses a syntax extension of javascript called JSX. JSX allows us to embed javascript into our HTML by wrapping the javascript in curly braces. To use the javascript variable "testimonial" in our HTML, we just need to add curly braced around it.

>This might be a good time to discuss JSX briefly and how it is used in React projects. To learn more about JSX please refer to the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)


>As the instructor, it might be good to pause before editing line 25 and console.log(props) in the Testimonials component. Students will then be able to see that there is an object that has been passed down to Testimonials component. They will also be able to see that the props object contains a key with the same name as the attribute we added to Testimonials element in App.js.

In the example we just did, we passed a hard-coded string down as the prop "userTestimonial." We can also pass down a javascript variable (or even a function! But that's for another time) as a prop. Lets try this by refactoring our code a bit. We are going to create a variable called "testimonial" and set it equal to our previous review. Then we can pass it down as a prop by using JSX syntax as seen below:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    let testimonial = "We Eat Street Meat is the best food review site that has ever been built. Now I can eat my street meat with confidence I can sit through my afternoon meetings."
    return (
      <div className="App">
       	<Navbar/>
	<Splash/>
        <Testimonials userTestimonial = { testimonial }/>
    	<div className = "container">
    	  <div className="row">

          </div>
    	</div>
    </div>
    );
  }
}
```

![Testimonials](./images/testimonials.png)

If done correctly, our web site should look like the example above.

### Passing Multiple Properties
We can pass multiple props down to a component, allowing us to use a component as a template that can be customized. By passing more props, we can add more and more customizations to our components. This is how the component we looked at the beginning of class might have had the same size or styling, but completely different images and text.

To complete We Eat Street Meat, we need to add reviews to our site. We have saved the reviews in a separate file, which we will import into our App component and then pass down as props to multiple review cards.

>It should be mentioned that the review_data file is serving as our "database" in this application. In a real application, we wouldn't save the reviews in a static file, but rather have saved in a database that is loaded when the website is reached.

Lets create our first review card by adding the following code to our App.js file:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    let testimonial = "We Eat Street Meat is the best food review site that has ever been built. Now I can eat my street meat with confidence I can sit through my afternoon meetings."
    return (
      <div className="App">
       	<Navbar/>
	<Splash/>
        <Testimonials userTestimonial = { testimonial }/>
    	<div className = "container">
    	  <div className="row">
            <ReviewCard
              name={ reviews.review_array[0].name}
              headline={ reviews.review_array[0].headline}
              summary={ reviews.review_array[0].summary}
              stars={ reviews.review_array[0].stars}
              posted={ reviews.review_array[0].posted}
            />
          </div>
    	</div>
    </div>
    );
  }
}
```

The first step is to create a Review Card element and add the attributes as seen above.

>To help students understand how this nested data is being extracted from the array, it would be a good idea to console.log(review) and look at the review object. Then, walk students through how to get the first name from the review review in the array, the first headline, etc.

```javascript
function ReviewCard(props){
	return(
	  <div className="col-4 Review">
	    <div className="card text-center mb-3r">
	      <div className="card-header">
	        { props.name }
	      </div>
	      <div className="card-body">
	        <h5 className="card-title">{ props.headline }</h5>
	        <p className="card-text">{ props.summary }</p>
	        <p className="card-text">{ props.stars }</p>
	        <a href="#" className="btn btn-warning">Full Review</a>
	      </div>
	      <div className="card-footer text-muted">
	       { props.posted }
	      </div>
	    </div>
	  </div>
	);
};
```

Now we need to modify ReviewCard.js to utilize the props that are being passed down to it.

![Example Review](./images/review-cards.png)

If done correctly, the review should appear as shown above.

#### Question for Students
* How could we pass the review data to each card using only one attribute?

#### Mini-challenges
* Complete the website by creating a review card for each of the six reviews
* Refactor your code so that you **iterate** through the review data and create each card programmatically (rather than hard coding each one). Try researching how to do this!


## Close
Remember to gather student feedback on this lesson. In addition to the standard close, consider priming students for feedback with the following questions.

#### Questions for Students
> * What is the key benefit to building components with props?
> * Look at the NYT.com website. Find all the components that are most likely built with props.
